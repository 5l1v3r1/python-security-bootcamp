==========

- The reading materials to each level is still to be updated.
- Learn by yourself, try hard - harder however you want before you give up. Get your basics right.


Solutions

- Solutions for each level are vague/simplest way to be done, you may or may not have written a better script for the solution.
- Please do not look at the solution before you have tried and failed to the limit you have, otherwise there isn't a point of this repo and the people contributing to the repo.
